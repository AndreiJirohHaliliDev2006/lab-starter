# Hi there ðŸ‘‹!

Hello @{{user.login}}, I'm so excited to teach you how to make your own `code-server` workspace in your PaaS service of choice.

## What is `code-server`?

code-server is just like [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode), but in your browser. You install the server [in any supported PaaS service that supports Docker](https://github.com/cdr/deploy-code-server) and even install it on your servers. But for this course, we'll craft our own deploy-code-server template repo.

Let's have an closer look between the standalone code-server and its SaaS service Coder.
