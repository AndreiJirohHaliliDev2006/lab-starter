# Repository setup
# The following section template information for the repository
# This will be used when the repository is crated for each individual learner

template:
  name: # the name of the repository when it is created for the learner
  repo: # the name of the template repository from which to clone for the learner

# `before` block
# Actions to take place after the learner registers, but before they start interacting with their repo

before:
- type: # the type of action, full list at https://lab.github.com/docs/actions/
  # some actions require additional options, those should appear below `type:`
  # you can execute multiple actions in the `before` block

# Steps for the course
# A list of steps that take the learner through the course
# Create one step for each action that a learner will complete
