[code-server](https://github.com/cdr/code-server is an VS Code-like app that runs in your browser, but in reality it's on an server to save resources on your local machine and to speed up development. It's much like [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) and even [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), but in an Docker container.

Over the duration of this course you will learn the skills needed to create an custom Docker image containing `code-server` and the needed tools you choose, build and publish to Docker Hub with GitHub Actions and deploy with your PaaS service of choice and even explore the features of it.

## What you'll learn

In this course you will learn how to:

- Build your own `deploy-code-server-container` Docker image.
- Build and publish to Docker Hub using GitHub Actions
- Deploy and explore the features of code-server, including the differences between the VS Code/GitHub Codespaces and code-server

## What you'll build

In this course you will create your own `deploy-code-server` template repo from strach, build the image with GitHub Actions

## Prerequisites

New to GitHub Actions? We first recommend taking the following GitHub Learning Hub courses:

- [Hello, GitHub Actions!](https://lab.github.com/github/hello-github-actions!) to learn the basics of how GitHub Actions work
- [GitHub Actions: Continuous Integration](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/github-actions:-continuous-integration) to dive deeper into a workflow fil

If you're new to Dockerfiles and Docker itself, here are quick resources that we think it helps before diving into this repo:
